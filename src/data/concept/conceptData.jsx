          In a decentralized social networking system, users are afforded
          substantial control over their data. This empowerment enables

          audiences with whom they wish to share information, and regulate the
          frequency of content exposure. Such autonomy serves to alleviate

          One of the defining characteristics of decentralized social networks
          is their inherent resistance to censorship. In the absence of a
          centralized governing authority, these platforms are less susceptible
          to the suppression of content or voices influenced by political,
          commercial, or ideological pressures. This quality fosters an
          environment conducive to diverse viewpoints and open discussions,

          decentralized SNSs include Mastodon, recognized for its federated
          architecture; Diaspora, which focuses on user privacy and data
          ownership; and Scuttlebutt, a peer-to-peer protocol facilitating
          offline social interactions. Each platform employs distinct approaches
